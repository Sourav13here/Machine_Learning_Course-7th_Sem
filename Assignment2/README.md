# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts housing prices based on different features (area, bedrooms, bathrooms, location, etc.) using **Linear Regression**.  
It also evaluates model performance using **R² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and custom accuracy** (within ±10%).  
Additionally, the project simulates **epochs** by re-training the model multiple times with different train/test splits, and plots **Accuracy vs Epoch** and **Loss vs Epoch** graphs.

## Features

-  **Custom Dataset Handling**
  - Loads housing dataset (`Housing.csv`)  
  - Uses only two columns: **Area (sq.ft.)** and **Price**  
  - Cleans data by removing missing values  

-  **Preprocessing**
  - Extracts features (`area`) and target (`price`)  
  - Standardizes feature values for stable gradient descent  

-  **Linear Regression (From Scratch)**
  - Implements **Batch Gradient Descent** without using scikit-learn  
  - Learns slope (`w`) and intercept (`b`)  
  - Converts parameters back to original scale (price per sq.ft.)  

-  **Model Evaluation**
  - Tracks **Loss (MSE)** per epoch  
  - Computes **Accuracy (R² score)** per epoch  
  - Prints progress for each epoch  

-  **Visualizations**
  - **Epoch vs Accuracy (R²)**
